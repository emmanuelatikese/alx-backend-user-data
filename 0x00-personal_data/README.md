### Brief Documentation on Logging, re Library, and Personal Data
Logging
Logging is the process of recording information about the execution of a program. Logs are essential for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining software systems.

Key Concepts
Log Levels: Indicate the severity or importance of the logged message.
DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.
WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.
ERROR: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
CRITICAL: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.
